## Future Enhancements üöÄ

Here's what I plan for the next iteration of **Melius**:

- **Donation Feature**: Allow users to support the platform through donations.
- **Voice Chat**: Enable voice communication between users for additional support.
- **Goal Setting**: Add a feature to set monthly or weekly goals. Completing these goals will reward users with points or achievements.

- **Graphs of users progress.**

- **Tests**: Add a feature to make users take small quizzes to measure their addiction levels.

- **AI**: Add an AI engine to manage posts.

There's always room to refine and evolve this project, and I'm excited about future possibilities.
